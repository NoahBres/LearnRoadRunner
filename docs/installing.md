# Installing

There are two methods to installing the Road Runner library.

[Method #1](#method-1-downloading-the-quickstart), the simpler option, is to simply download [the quickstart repo](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart). The quickstart repo is an empty FTC season repo along with the preinstalled dependencies and tuning opmodes to get Road Runner up and running. It includes everything you'll need to get Road Runner up and running. However, this does not work if you already have an existing codebase.

[Method #2](#method-2-installing-rr-on-your-project) will go through installing Road Runner via gradle and copying over the necessary files from the quickstart repo into your existing team project.

Afterwards, it is highly recommended to upgrade your Rev Expansion Hub or Control Hub Firmware. Directions can be found [below](#upgrading-firmware).

## Method 1: Downloading the Quickstart

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart)
2. Click the big green download button

3. Unzip/extract the folder into your directory of choice
4. Open up the folder in Android studio.
5. Voilà! You now have everything you need to get Road Runner up and going.

## Method 2: Installing RR on Your Project

1. We are are going to assume you have the same file structure as the standard FTC provided project. This can be found [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController). Please use the latest FTC SDK. Sections of this installation instruction have been removed as they are no longer needed in the newest SDK. Thus, these installation instructions will not work for versions below the 6.0 SDK.
2. Look for the `TeamCode/build.release.gradle` file. Specifically the one in the `TeamCode` folder.

3. In `TeamCode/build.release.gradle`, add the following three dependencies:

   - `implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'`
   - `implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.2'`
   - `implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'`

```groovy{10-13}
/* TeamCode/build.release.gradle */
dependencies {
    implementation project(':FtcRobotController')
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotCore:6.0.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Hardware:6.0.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:FtcCommon:6.0.1'
    implementation (name: 'tfod-release', ext:'aar')
    implementation (name: 'tensorflow-lite-0.0.0-nightly', ext:'aar')

    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'

    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.2'
    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'
}
```

6. We now need to copy over all the java files from the `TeamCode` folder located in the online quickstart repo (all the files from [this folder](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode)). Copy over all the files from both the `drive` and `util` folder into a location in your project, preferably just your `TeamCode` folder. These classes include all the files and utilities required for tuning and dashboard logging.

7. Finally, you must edit your `FtcRobotControllerActivity.java` file to work with ftc-dashboard. Directions can be found [here](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/gettingstarted). Or just copy the `FtcRobotControllerActivity.java` file from the quickstart repo [here](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart/blob/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/FtcRobotControllerActivity.java) and paste it into your project. Replace the `FtcRobotControllerActivity.java` file located in <span class="break-words">`YourFTCProject/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/FtcRobotControllerActivity.java`</span> with the file you downloaded from that GitHub link.

## Upgrading Firmware

It is highly recommended that you upgrade the firmware on your Control Hub or Expansion Hub to the latest version. Firmware version 1.8.2 brings a number of improvements including: DC motor output linearity, improved close-loop controls, improved I2C speeds, and USB recovery for ESD faults. Road Runner's performance directly benefits from these improvements.

Explicit directions to upgrade the Expansion/Control Hub firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Managing-a-Control-Hub#Updating-the-Expansion-Hub-Firmware).

Directions to upgrade the Expansion Hub firmware can be found [here](http://www.revrobotics.com/software/#ExpansionHubFirmware).

**That's it!** You're set! The installation process is done. Now go on ahead and start tuning.
