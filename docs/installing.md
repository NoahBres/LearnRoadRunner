# Installing

There are two methods to installing the Road Runner library.
::: warning
As Road Runner becomes legacy software, the quickstart might not be up to date with the minimum legal SDK after the 2023-24 season. If you get an error on your driver station saying that the robot controller is obsolete, download the official SDK from FIRST [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) and use [Method #2](#method-2-installing-rr-on-your-project).
:::

[Method #1](#method-1-downloading-the-quickstart), the simpler option, is to simply download [the quickstart repo](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart/tree/quickstart1). The quickstart repo is an empty FTC season repo along with the preinstalled dependencies and tuning opmodes to get Road Runner up and running. However, this does not work if you already have an existing codebase.

[Method #2](#method-2-installing-rr-on-your-project) will go through installing Road Runner via gradle and copying over the necessary files from the quickstart repo into your existing team project.

Afterwards, it is highly recommended to upgrade your Rev Expansion Hub or Control Hub Firmware. Directions can be found [below](#upgrading-firmware).

## Method 1: Downloading the Quickstart

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart/tree/quickstart1](https://github.com/Iris-TheRainbow/RoadRunnerQuickstart15031) (this is a quickstart maintained by Iris_TheRainbow, not acmerobotics, but should remain more up to date than the official quickstart)
2. Click the big green download button

3. Unzip/extract the folder into your directory of choice
4. Open Android Studio. If you have no previous projects open, then choose Import Project. If you do, then go to File > New > Import Project.
5. Find the folder where you extracted the zip contents and open it to find the project folder. IMPORTANT: Sometimes when you extract zip folders the contents are double-foldered; i.e there is a folder that contains the project folder. If you import the outer folder, your project will not work correctly. Be sure that you choose to import the project folder (This should have an Android icon on it). Both of the folders might have the same/similar names, so pay attention!
6. Once you have found the project folder (with the Android Icon on it), select it and click "Import".
7. Wait for the following Gradle Build to finish. If this is the first time you have used Android Studio, then you might have to accept the SDK Licenses. If your Gradle build/sync fails with an error like that, go to Tools > SDK Manager. Find Android 10 (API 29) in the list, and check the box next to it. Then click "OK" and let Android Studio download what it needs. You will have to accept the license that it prompts you with.
8. Voilà! You now have everything you need to get Road Runner up and going. If you still have farther issues, please ask in the FTC Discord.

## Method 2: Installing RR on Your Project

::: warning
These installation instructions are accurate as of SDK 9.1. There is no guarantee that they will stay accurate for future SDK releases.
:::

1. We are are going to assume you have the same file structure as the _latest_ (**9.1** at the time of writing) standard FTC provided project. This can be found [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController).

2. Look for the `build.dependencies.gradle` file at the root of your project.

3.  Add the following snippet at the end of the `repositories` block:

    `maven { url = 'https://maven.brott.dev/' }`

    Then, add the following snippet at the end of your `dependencies` block:

    `implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.4.15'`
::: warning
These instructions are up to date as of writing (2/17/2024), and the version number will not always be accurate. Especially once the 2024-2025 FTC season starts, you will have to visit [this website](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/gettingstarted) and used the latest version to have an updated field diagram in the field view.
:::

If you are using [OpenRC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC-Turbo), please read the Dashboard specific instructions [here](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/gettingstarted)

4. Look for the `TeamCode/build.gradle` file. Specifically the one in the `TeamCode` folder.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
::: vue
<span class="folder">FtcRobotController</span>
├── <span class="folder">.github</span>
├── <span class="folder">FtcRobotController</span>
├── <span class="folder">TeamCode</span>

├── <span class="file">gradlew</span>
├── <span class="file">gradlew.bat</span>
└── <span class="file">settings.gradle</span>
:::

5. In `TeamCode/build.gradle`, add the following dependencies:

   - `implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'`
   - `implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.12.7'`
   - `implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.6'`

```groovy{9-11}
/* TeamCode/build.gradle */
apply from: '../build.common.gradle'
apply from: '../build.dependencies.gradle'

dependencies {
    implementation project(':FtcRobotController')
    annotationProcessor files('lib/OpModeAnnotationProcessor.jar')

    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.12.7'
    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.6'
}
```

6. Go to this [repo](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart/tree/quickstart1) and download it either using `git clone --single-branch -b quickstart1 https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart.git` (if you have git installed) or clicking on the green `Code` button and press `Download ZIP`.
7. Navigate to the `TeamCode` folder, and move the `drive`, `util`, and `trajectorysequence` folders into a location in your project, preferably in your `TeamCode` folder. These classes include all the files and utilities required for tuning and dashboard logging.

## Upgrading Firmware

It is highly recommended that you upgrade the firmware on your Control Hub or Expansion Hub to the latest version. Firmware version 1.8.2 brings a number of improvements including: DC motor output linearity, improved close-loop controls, improved I2C speeds, and USB recovery for ESD faults. Road Runner's performance directly benefits from these improvements.

Directions to upgrade the Control/Expansion Hub firmware can be found [in the REV docs](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-control-system/managing-the-control-system/updating-firmware).

**That's it!** You're set! The installation process is done. Now go on ahead and start tuning.
