# Spline Test

1. Once your `TRANSLATION` and `HEADING` PID's are tuned, you should run the spline test to make sure everything is in order.
2. Open dashboard to make sure that it's following correctly. The bot should follow an S-shaped path and Dashboard should follow the path properly.
3. If something goes wrong, try and go back to diagnose the problem. Hit up the [FTC Discord](https://discord.gg/first-tech-challenge) if you're stuck.
