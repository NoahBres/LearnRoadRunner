# LearnRoadRunner

An opinionated guide and documentation for Road Runner

## Notes:

- `package.json` requires a downgrade to `watchpack` because later updates break live reloading.
  - https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/issues/2392#issuecomment-638548192

## TODO:

- Finish overloading constraints section

- Finish gain scheduling section

- support fancy image/video formats (webm, webp, etc)

- yell at user if they use I or D in velo pid

- remove underline in the trajectories page

- optimize for cumulative layout shift
